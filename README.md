* Nov 6 Lecture Notes [(interactive)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zhentaoshi/MSc-notes/master?filepath=time_series.ipynb) [(static PDF)](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/MSc-notes/blob/master/time_series.pdf)
  * Reading: Sheppard Ch 4.2, 4.4, 4.10.1-5; Ch 5.6, 5.8.5, 5.9




The IPython notebook can also be executed locally if IPython, IRkernel and the required R packages are installed.

It is possible that Binder takes time to prepare the first session (about 10 minutes, say). Be patient. Such inconvenience only occurs if you are the first user to run the notebook online after a new Git commit.
