### IPython Notebook 

The IPython notebook can also be executed locally if IPython, IRkernel and the required R packages are installed. [nteract](https://nteract.io/) is cross-platform user-friendly open-source software to open IPython notebooks.

For most users, the Binder session should be ready within one minute for interaction. However, if you happen to be the first user to run the notebook online after a new Git commit, it may take time to prepare the first session (about 10 minutes, say). It you encounter such delay, be patient; leave the browser open and Binder running.
